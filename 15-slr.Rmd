# Geocomputation for sea level research

Sea level rise (SLR) is a worldwide phenemona with major implications for human civilisation.
Despite the globally interconnected nature of the oceans, the rates and likely impacts of SLR have a strong spatial footprint.
Some countries such as Norway are actually increasing in height and have limited exposure while in some, such as Bangladesh, millions of people are at risk from catastrophic SLR-related flooding.
These imacts are exacerbated by climate change, adding an element of uncertainty and dynamics to the problem.
All these features of SLR make it well-suited to analysis using geocomputation.
