## Introduction

In no other sector is geographic space more tangible than transport.
It is the effort of moving, particularly between places that are far apart, that led to the 'first law' of geography defined by Waldo Tobler in 1970 as follows [@miller_toblers_2004]: 

> Everything  is related  to  everything  else,  but  near  things  are more  related  than  distant  things

This 'law' applies to phenomena as diverse as friendship networks and ecological diversity and can be explained by the costs of transport --- in terms of time, energy and money.
These costs are known as the 'friction of distance'.
Thus transport technologies disrupt geographic relationships from the perspective of mobile humans and goods: "the purpose of transportation is to overcome space" [@rodrigue_geography_2013].

Transport is an inherently geospatial activity.
It involves traversing continuous geographic space between A and B, and infinite localities in between.
It is therefore unsurprising that transport researchers have long turned to geocomputational methods to understand movement patterns and that transport problems are a motivator of geocomputational methods.

This chapter provides an introduction to geographic analysis of transport systems.
We will explore how movement patterns can be understood at multiple geographic levels, including:

- **Areal units**: transport can be understood simply in terms of zonal aggregates such as the main mode and average distance of trips made people living in a particular zone.
- **Nodes**: these are points in the transport system that can represent common origins and destinations (e.g. with one centroid per zone) and public transport stations such as bus stops and rail stations.
- **Desire lines**: straight lines that represent 'origin-destination' data that records how many people travel (or could travel) between places (points or zones) in geographic space.
- **Routes**: these are cirquitous (non-straight) routes, typically representing the 'optimal' path along the route network between origins and destinations along the desire lines defined in the previous bullet point.
- **Route networks**: these represent the system of roads, paths and other linear features in an area. They can be represented as purely geographic entities or as a graph.
Their features are segments which can be assigned values representing 'flow', the number of people expected to use a particular street or path.
- **Agents**: these are the lowest-level but hardest to model entities in transport systems --- mobile entities like you and me.

Much transport research use on only a few of these because models involving all six levels, such as [MATSim](http://www.matsim.org/), are complex and computationally demanding [@horni_multi-agent_2016].
Beyond geographic levels, the basic unit of analysis in most transport models is the 'trip', a single purpose journey from an orgin 'A' to a destination 'B' [@hollander_transport_2016].
Trips join-up the six geographic levels: they are usually represented as *desire lines* connecting *zone* centroids (*nodes*), they can be allocated onto the *route network* as *routes*, and are made by people who can be represented as *agents*.

An addition complication is time.
Although many trips are regular and predictable --- such as the daily commute to work --- transport systems are dynamic and constantly evolving at many levels of temporal resolution.
The purpose of geographic transport modelling can be interpretted as simplifying this complexity in a way that captures the essence of transport problems.
Selecting an appropriate level of geographic analysis can help simplify this complexity, to capture the essence of a transport system without loosing its most important features and variables [@hollander_transport_2016].

Typically models are designed to solve a particular problem.
For this reason this chapter is based around a policy scenario that asks:
how to increase walking and cycling in the city of Bristol?
The case study city is a coastal settlement in the West of England, described in the next section.

<!-- Idea: make it about reducing CO2 emissions instead. Thoughts? + Multi-model - more complex -->

## A case study of Bristol {#bris-case}

The case study used for this chapter is a city on the west of England, around 30 km East of the Welsh capital Cardiff.
The area's transport network is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:bristol), which shows that Bristol is provided by a diverse range transport infrastructure, for travelling by bicycle, train and private motor vehicle.

Bristol is the 10^th^ largest city council in England, with a population of half a million people, although its travel catchment area is larger (see section \@ref(transport-zones)).
It has a vibrant economy with aerospace, media, financial service and tourism, alongside two major universities.
Bristol has high average income per capita but contains areas of severe deprivation [@bristol_city_council_deprivation_2015].

In terms of transport, Bristol is well served by rail and road links, and has a relatively high level of active travel.
19% of its citizens cycle and 88% walk at least once per month according to the [Active People Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/how-often-and-time-spent-walking-and-cycling-at-local-authority-level-cw010#table-cw0103) (the national average is 15% and 81% respectively).
8% of the population reported cycling to work in the 2011 census, compared with only 3% nationwide.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
if(!require(readODS)) {
  install.packages("readODS")

View(readODS::read_ods("Table index.ods"))
cw0103 = readODS::read_ods("cw0103.ods")
View(cw0103)
```

Despite impressive walking and cycling statistics, the city has a major congestion problem.
Part of the solution is to continue increase the proportion of trips made by cycling.
Cycling has a greater potential to replace car trips than walking because of the speed of this mode, around 3-4 times faster than walking (with typical [speeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_performance) of 15-20 km/h vs 4-6 km/h for walking).
There is therefore a [plan](http://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/interview-bristols-mayor-george-ferguson-24114) to double the mode share of cycling by 2020.

In this policy context the aim of this chapter, beyond demonstrating how geocomputation with R can be used to support sustainable transport planning, is to provide evidence for decision-makers in Bristol to decide how best to increase the mode share of walking and cycling in particular in the city.
This high-level aim will be met via the following objectives:

- Describe the geographical pattern of transport behaviour in the city.
- Identify key nodes and potential bottlenecks where walking and cycling potential is likely to be highest.
- Analyse travel 'desire lines' in the city to identify those with greatest potential for modal shift.
- Building on the desire-line level analysis, identify which routes would most benefit from having dedicated cycleways and improved provision for pedestrians. 

To get the wheels rolling on the practical aspects of this chapter, we begin by loading zonal data on travel paterns.
These zone-level data are small but often vital for gaining a basic understanding of a settlement's overall transport system.

## Transport zones

Although transport systems are primarily based on linear features and nodes --- including pathways and stations --- it often makes sense to start with areal data.
Three types of zone will typically be of particular interest: the study region, origin zones (typically residential areas), and destination zones (which are often the same as the origin zones).

The simplest way to define a study area is often the first matching boundary returned by OpenStreetMap, which can be obtained using the development version of **osmdata** as follows:

<!-- Todo: remove 'development version' when this goes on CRAN -->

```{r, eval=FALSE}
region_bb = osmdata::getbb("Bristol", format_out = "sf_polygon")
```

The result is an `sf` object representing the bounds of the largest matching city region, either a rectangular polygon of the bounding box or detailed polygonal boundary (see Figure \@ref(fig:zones)).^[
In this case the command returns a detailed polygon representing official boundary of Bristol.
Commonly only rectangular bounding boxes are provided by OSM.
In cases where the first match does not provide the right name, the country or region should be specified, for example `Bristol Tennessee` for an America Bristol.
]
This approach may not always be appropriate, however: boundaries in OSM may not be the same as boundaries used by the local transport planning authority.
More importantly, official administrative zones seldom relate to where people in them travel.

Travel to Work Areas (TTWAs) overcome this issue by creating a zoning system analogous to hydrological watersheds.
TTWAs were first defined as contiguous zones within which 75% of the population travels work [@coombes_efficient_1986], and this is the definition used in this chapter.
Because Bristol is a major employer attracting travel from surrounding towns, its TTWA --- loaded in the command below --- is substantially larger than its administratively defined area (see Figure \@ref(fig:zones)).

```{r}
region_ttwa = readRDS("extdata/bristol-ttwa.rds")
```

The origin and destination zones used in this chapter are the same: officially defined zones of intermediate geographic resolution (their [official](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/bulletins/annualsmallareapopulationestimates/2014-10-23) name is Middle layer Super Output Areas or MSOAs).
Each house around 8,000 people.
Such administrative zones can provide vital context to transport analysis, such as the *type* of people who benefit (or loose out from) particular interventions.

The geographic resolution of these zones is important: small zones with high geographic resolution are usually preferable but their high number in large regions can have consequences for processing (especially for origin-destination analysis in which the number of possibilities increases as a non-linear function of the number of zones).
Another issue with small zones is related to anonymity rules: more socio-demographic variables are often available for large zones.

The 102 zones used are illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:zones).
These can be loaded from the `exdata` folder of the book:

```{r}
zones = readRDS("extdata/bristol-zones.rds")
```

This dataset provides a useful basis for dividing-up space into meaningful chunks, with each zone housing a similar number of people.
However at present the dataset contains no attribute data, other than the zone name and zone code:

```{r}
names(zones)
```

Chapter \@ref(attr) demonstrated how to join attribute data onto geographic variables.
This is a common task in geographic data analysis.
Usually a table containing data per zone would be joined directly via a shared key variable: the geographic zone code or name (see the [ons.gov.uk website](https://www.ons.gov.uk/help/localstatistics) to access attribute data at a range of geographic levels in the UK).
For the perposes of this chapter an additional stage is needed because the input data is provided at the orgin-destination level:
before joining it to the zones we need to aggregate the OD data on mode of travel between zones in the `od` object to residential (origin) zones (the nature of this OD dataset is described in more detail in section \@ref(desire-lines)):

```{r}
od = readRDS("extdata/bristol-od.rds")
zones_attr = od %>%
  group_by(o) %>% 
  summarise_if(is.numeric, sum) %>% 
  rename(geo_code = o)
```

The above code chunk may seem complex long but the methods have already been covered, in Chapter \@ref(attr).
The three main operations accomplished by chaining together **dplyr** commands in this way were:

- Grouping the OD pairs by the zone of origin (contained in the column `o`), ready to be summarized at this level
- Summarizing variables in the `od` dataset *if they were numeric* to find the `sum()` total of people who live in each zone who travel by each mode of transport (the `_if` affix requires a `TRUE`/`FALSE` question to be asked of the variables, in this case 'is it numeric?' and only variables returning true are summarized)
- Renaming the grouping variable `o` so its new name matches the ID column in the `zones` data

Beyond refreshing know-how learned in Part I and building on it by demonstrating how the `_if()` modifier works, the previous code chunk has generated a useful result:
a data frame with rows representing zones and an ID variable that matches the IDs of the `zones` dataset (this is verified below):

```{r}
summary(zones_attr$geo_code %in% zones$geo_code)
```

After preprocessing the attribute data it is in a format that can be joined directly onto the zones.
As illustrated in the summary of the resulting object, the result is a geographic object with useful attributes including population of travellers (almost 1/4 of a million) and their main mode of travel (by bicycle, foot, car and train):

```{r}
zones = left_join(zones, zones_attr)
sum(zones$all)
names(zones)
```

```{r zones, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Regional boundaries (the thick black line represents the Travel to Work Area (TTWA), the thinner black boundary represents the OSM boundary) for Bristol and the number of people working in the (TTW) per zone.", message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/34133431-8514e494-e44c-11e7-93e2-819ff81ea5ca.png")
```

In the same way that OD datasets can be aggregated to the zone of origin, they can also be aggregated to provide information about destination zones.
People tend to gravitate towards central places.
This explains why the spatial distribution represented in Figure \@ref(fig:destzones) is relatively uneven, with the most common destination zones concentrated in Bristol city centre.
The map was created using the following code:

```{r destzones, fig.cap="Destination zones"}
zones = od %>%
  group_by(d) %>% 
  summarise_if(is.numeric, sum) %>% 
  select(geo_code = d, all_dest = all) %>% 
  inner_join(zones, ., by = "geo_code")
plot(zones["all_dest"])
```

## Nodes on the transport system

Nodes in geographic transport data are zero dimensional features (points) among the predominantly one dimension features (lines) that comprise the network.
There are two types of transport nodes:

1. Nodes not directly on the network such as zone centroids  --- covered in the next section --- or individual origins and destinations such as houses and workplaces.
2. Nodes that are a part of transport networks, representing individual pathways, intersections between pathways (junctions) and points for entering or exiting a transport network such as bus stops and train stations.

From a mathematical perspective transport networks are simply large graphs.
The second type of nodes are nodes on this graph, each of which is connected by one or more straight 'edges' that represent individual segments on the network.

```{r}
rail_stations = readRDS("extdata/rail_stations.rds")
```



## Desire lines

We have already loaded data representing desire lines in the dataset `od`.
This origin-destination (OD) data frame object represents the number of people travelling between the zone represented in `o` and `d`, as illustrated in Table \@ref(tab:od).
This subset of the data was using attribute operations described in Chatper \@ref(attr), to arrange the OD data by all trips and then filter-out only the top 5:

```{r}
od_top5 = od %>% 
  arrange(desc(all)) %>% 
  top_n(5, wt = all)
```

```{r od, echo=FALSE}
od_top5 %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Sample of the origin-destination data stored in the data frame object `od`. These represent the top 5 most common desire lines between zones in the study area.")
```

This table provides a snapshot of Bristolian travel patterns demonstrating, for example, that walking is the most popular mode of transport among the top 5 inter-zonal origin-destination pairs and that zone `E02003043` is a popular destination.
But from a policy perspective it's useless:
aside from the fact that it contains only a tiny portion of the `r nrow(od)` OD pairs, there is no way of deciding *where* policy measures are needed to boost walking and cycling.
What is needed is a way to plot this origin-destination data on the map.

The solution is to convert the non-geographic `od` dataset into geographical desire lines that can be plotted on a map.
The geographic representation of the data presented in Table \@ref(tab:od) are displayed as straight black lines in \@ref(fig:desire): these are clearly more useful from a policy perspective.
The conversion from `data.frame` to `sf` class is done in the code below which matches the IDs in the first two columns of the `od` object to the `zone_code` ID column in the geographic `zones` object.^[
Note that the operation emits a warning: this is because the **stplanr** function `od2line()` used to create the desire lines works by allocating the start and end points of each origin-destination pair to the *centroid* of its zone of origin and destination.
This represents a straight line between the centroid of zone `E02003047` and the centroid of `E02003043` for the second origin-destination pair represented in Table \@ref(tab:od), for example.
For real-world use one would use centroid values generated from projected data or, preferably, use *population-weighted* centroids.
<!-- Todo: add PCT reference (RL) -->
]

```{r}
desire_lines = od2line(od, zones)
```

The above code generates a geographic object `desire_lines` (of class `sf`) that allows the `od` object to be plotted on the map and, vitally, used to inform geographically targetted transport policies.
The `desire_lines` can now be plotted using plot commands such as that provided in the command below.
The results, illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:desire), demonstrate that Bristol city centre is by far the largest trip attractor in the region.
However, there are several peripheral sub-centres including Bradford Stoke to the North and Portishead to the West.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(desire_lines$geometry)
```

```{r desire, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Desire lines representing the centrality of Bristol City Centre in the region's transport patterns. The width of the red lines is proportional to commute trips between zones. The 5 black lines represent sample origin-destination data shown in Table 8.1."}
u_od = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/34081176-74fd39c8-e341-11e7-9f3e-b98807cb113b.png"

# tm_shape(desire_lines) +
#   tm_lines(lwd = "all", scale = 5) +
#   tm_shape(desire_lines_top5) +
#   tm_lines(lwd = 20, col = "black") +
#   tm_scale_bar()
```

## Route analysis

## Route networks

The data used in this section was downloaded using **osmdata**.
To avoid having to request the data from OSM repeadetly, we'll use a locally saved version of the data, which contains point and line data for the case study area:

```{r}
ways = readRDS("extdata/ways.rds")
summary(ways)
```

The above code chunk loaded a simple feature object representing around 3,000 segments on the transport network.
This an easily manageable dataset size (transport datasets be large but it's best to start small).

As mentioned, route networks can usefully be represented as mathematical graphs, with nodes on the network connected by edges.
A number of R packages have been developed for dealing with such graphs, notably **igraph**.
One can manually convert a route network into an `igraph` object, but that process risks loosing the geographic attributes.
To overcome this issue `SpatialLinesNetwork()` was developed in the **stplanr** package to represent route networks simultaneously as graphs *and* a set of geographic lines.
This function is demonstrated below using a subset of the `ways` object used in previous sections.

```{r}
ways_freeway = ways %>% filter(maxspeed == "70 mph") 
ways_sln = SpatialLinesNetwork(ways_freeway)
slotNames(ways_sln)
weightfield(ways_sln)
class(ways_sln@g)
```

The output of the previous code chunk shows that `ways_sln` is a composite object with various 'slots'.
These include: the spatial component of the network (named `sl`), the graph component (`g`) and the 'weightfield', the edge variable used for shortest path calculation (by default segment distance).
`ways_sln` is of class `sfNetwork`, defined by the S4 class system.
This means that each component can be accessed using the `@` operator, which is used below to extract its graph component and process it using the **igraph** package, before plotting the results in geographic space.
In the example below the 'edge betweeness' is calculated, with the results demonstrating that each graph edge represents a segment: the segments near the centre of the road network have the greatest betweeness scores.

```{r}
g = ways_sln@g
e = igraph::edge_betweenness(ways_sln@g)
plot(ways_sln@sl$geometry, lwd = e / 500)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# not producing groups of routes so removing for now...
m = igraph::clusters(g)
igraph::V(g)$m = m$membership
gdf = as_long_data_frame(g)
```


One can also find the shortest route between origins and destinations using this graph representation of the route network:

```{r}
path = sum_network_routes(ways_sln, 1, 20, "length")
plot(path$geometry, col = "red", lwd = 10)
plot(ways_sln@sl$geometry, add = TRUE)
```



## Agents in the transport system
