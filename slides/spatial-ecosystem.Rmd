# Introduction 

- From the course's home at [github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R/blob/master/course-info/intro-info.Rmd) and the CDRC website:


This one day course will get you up-to-speed with using R and RStudio for daily working with spatial data.
You will learn about R's powerful geospatial data processing, analysis and visualisation capabilities.
It is practical and hands-on: you'll *learn by doing*.
It assumes you already use R and want to extend your knowledge for spatial data applications.
It will cover the recently developed **sf** package, which is compatible with the **tidyverse**, representing the cutting-edge of spatial data applications.
It will provide a solid foundation (including spatial aggregation, joining, CRSs, visualisation) on which advanced analysis analysis workflows can be built.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

---

# Learning outcomes

By the end of the course participants will:

 - Understand R's spatial ecosystem and which packages are 'future proof'
 - Know how to optimize RStudio for productive working with spatial data (you should already be proficient with RStudio)
 - Be able to read and write a variety of spatial data formats
 - Be proficient at common spatial operations including subsetting, cropping, aggregation and transformation
 - Be a confident map maker using the powerful **tmap** package
 - Know where to look for learning more advanced methods
 
---
 
# Prerequisites

In preparation for the course you should:

- Ensure that you have the latest versions of R and RStudio installed on your laptop: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
- Brush up on your R skills if you're not an R user, e.g. with:
    - This excellent tutorial that you can work through to get used to the interface: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r
    - A more detailed account by Gillespie and Lovelace (2017): https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#rstudio
- Take a look at how GitHub works - we'll be using it for sharing course materials and sharing links and examples during the course, e.g. by reading this page (and following the tutorial if really keen): https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

# Test your set-up

This should work:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(raster)
library(spData)
```



```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("spData")
```

# R's spatial ecosystem

```{r cranlogs, fig.cap="The popularity of spatial packages in R. The y-axis shows the average number of downloads, within a 30-day rolling window, of R's top 5 spatial packages, defined as those with the highest number of downloads last month.", echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/figures/spatial-package-growth.png")
```

---

# Before spatial packages...

- Coordinates were treated as *just another variable*
- Issues with visualisation, spatial relations and consistency
- Major issues with Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs)

```{r}
library(spData) # see data(package = "spData") and ?afcon for more info
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.5}
plot(afcon$x, afcon$y)
```

---

# sp

- Released in 2005 (Pebesma and Bivand 2005)
- Raster and vector data (but mostly raster) supported
- We *won't* be using it but it *is* useful to know about ()

```{r}
library(sp)
data(meuse)
coords = SpatialPoints(meuse[c("x", "y")])
meuse = SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords, meuse)
str(meuse)
```

---

# sp visuals

12 year-old code still works ([Pebesma and Bivand 2005](https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2005-2.pdf))

```{r}
plot(meuse, pch=1, cex = .05*sqrt(meuse$zinc))
```

---

# Packages building on sp

**sp** has many *reverse dependencies*:

```{r}
sp_revdeps = devtools::revdep("sp", dependencies = "Depends")
head(sp_revdeps)
length(sp_revdeps)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
dd = cranlogs::cran_downloads(packages = sp_revdeps,
                              from = "2013-01-01", to = Sys.Date())
dd$Downloads <- ave(
  dd$count,
  dd$package,
  FUN = function(x)
    zoo::rollmean(x, k = 30, na.pad = T)
)
top_pkgs = dd %>% 
  filter(date > (Sys.Date() - 30)) %>% 
  group_by(package) %>%
  summarise(Downloads = mean(Downloads, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  top_n(n = 5, wt = Downloads) %>% 
  pull(package)
dd = dplyr::filter(dd, Downloads > 0, package %in% top_pkgs)

library(ggplot2)
ggfig = ggplot(data = dd, mapping = aes(date, Downloads, color = package)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Date", color = "Package: ")
ggsave("figures/sp-dep-package-growth.png", ggfig)
```


```{r}
sp_revimps = devtools::revdep("sp", dependencies = "Imports")
length(sp_revimps)
```

---

# Where to find out about packages?

Online (dur) but with guidance, e.g. from:

- The Spatial Taskview: https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html
- Section 4.4. of [Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/workflow.html#package-selection)

A few of note:

- **adehabitat** for ecological modelling
- **geosphere** for operations on a spherical surface
- **spdep** for modelling spatial data
- **rgdal** for reading/writing data

---

# The 5 most downloaded packages that depend on sp

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/31147295-49dd935a-a881-11e7-86a8-0e9d5c13fb84.png")
```

---

# sf

- Released in November 2016
- Aims to supersede **sp**, **rgdal** and **rgeos** with unified interface
- Treats spatial vector data as regular data frames
- The basis of much of this tutorial and *Geocomputation with R*
- Compatible with the *tidyverse* (Wickham and Grolemund 2016)

```{r}
library(sf)
world_tbl = dplyr::as_data_frame(world)
world_tbl
```

---

# raster

- A very large package first released in 2010
- Provides support for raster classes, and user friendly functions for vector data
- Very powerful

```{r, fig.asp=0.5}
library(raster)
r = raster(nrows = 3, ncols = 3)
values(r) = 1:9
plot(r)
```

---

# Visualisation packages

- **ggplot2** support for **sf**
- **leaflet** for low-level control of interactive maps
- **mapview** for GIS-like feel
- **tmap** powerful, flexible, user-friendly, general-purpose map-making

---

# Mini tmap demo

```{r}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
qtm(world, fill = "pop")
```
