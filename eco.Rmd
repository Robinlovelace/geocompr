Required knowledge: chapters 3, 4, chapter r-gis bridges, chapter spatial cross-validation

keywords: species distribution modeling, floristic modeling, spatial cross-validation, spatial autocorrelation, ordination (NMDS, Isomap), predictive mapping

structure:
1. intro ecological modeling and related applications beyond ecology
2. introduce research question, shortly the dataset and the planned approach
3. ordination
4. retrieving predictors and quick data exploration
5. modeling ordination scores most likely using machine-learning since we are mostly interested in spatial predictions, and because the mlr spatial cv approach is new, and finally because Alain Zuur's books cover statistical inference broadly
6. predictive mapping of floristic composition including spatial cross-validation
7. discussion: what could be done better or alternatives and again emphasizing that the methods shown
finally, point to books on ecological modeling especially emphasizing Alain Zuur's books

## Background
Fog oases are one of the most fascinating vegetation formations I have ever encountered. 
These formations, locally termed *lomas*, develop on mountains along the coastal deserts of Peru and Chile.
The desert's extreme harsh conditions and its remoteness spawned a truly unique and endemic flora and fauna on these mountains.
The annual rain input is less than 30-50 mm on average.
Still, plants survive this extreme aridity by combing out fog which develops below the temperature inversion caused by the cold Humboldt current in austral winter.
Every once in a few years, El Ni{\~n}o brings torrential rainfalls to this sun-baked environment causing on the one hand the desert to bloom, and on the other hand giving tree seedlings the chance to develop roots long enough to survive the following aridity.
Unfortunately, fog oases are heavily endangered mostly by human activities (grazing and agriculture) but also by climate change.
To effectively protect the last remnants of this unique vegetation formation, we need to know its floristic composition and spatial distribution.
*Lomas* mountains also have a touristical, i.e. economical value.
The vast majority of Peruvians are living in the coastal desert, and seldomly have a chance to leave it.
Scientists long found out that green oases are of utmost importance for human well-being, especially for metropolitan dwellers such as the people from Lima.
The only green space in the immediate vicinity of Lima are *lomas* mountains.
This even increases the immense recreational value of such green oases, and the need to effectively protect them.

In this chapter we would like to analyze the floristic composition of the southen slope of Mt. Mongón, a *lomas* mountain near Casma on the central northern coast of Peru.

We sampled the vascular plant vegetation on 100 randomly sampled 4x4 m^2^ plots in the austral winter of 2011 [@muenchow_predictive_2013]. 
The sampling coincided with a strong La Ni{\~n}a event, which even increased the aridity of the coastal desert but at the same time caused an increased fog activity on the *lomas* mountains of northern Peru.
We will use ordination techniques to extract the floristic gradient developing along the southern mountain slope.
We expect the ordination to distinguish four plant belts along the altitudinal gradient: a low-elevation *Tillandsia* belt, a herbaceous belt, a bromeliad belt, and an uppermost succulent belt [@muenchow_soil_2013].
Secondly, we would like to model the scores of the first ordination axis with environmental predictors such as slope, catchment area, altitude and NDVI.
The resulting model shall serve to make spatial predictions of the floristic composition.
When doing so, we will account for over-optimistic predictions in the presence of spatial autocorrelation using spatial cross-validation.

## Reducing dimensionality
Ordinations are a popular tool in vegetation science to extract the main information, frequently corresponding to ecological gradients, from large species-plot matrices mostly filled with 0s. 
However, they are also used in remote sensing (spectral bands + hyperspectral), the soil sciences, geomarketing, etc..
Principal component analysis (PCA) is probably the most famous ordination technique. 
It is a great tool to reduce dimensionality if one can expect linear relationships between variables, and if the joint absence of a variable (for example calcium) in two plots (observations) can be considered a similarity.
This is barely the case with vegetation data.
For one, relationships are usually non-linear along environmental gradients.
That means the presence of a plant usually follows a unimodal relationship along a gradient (e.g., humidity, temperature or salinity) with a peak at the most favorable conditions and declining ends towards the unfavarable conditions. 
Secondly, the joint absence of a species in two plots is often hardly an indication for similarity.
Suppose a plant species is absent from the driest (e.g., an extreme desert) and the most moist locations (e.g., a tree savannah) of our sampling.
Then we really should refrain from counting this as a simlilarity because it is very likely that the only thing these two completely different environmental settings have in common in terms of floristic composition is the shared absence of species (except for rare ubiquist species).
