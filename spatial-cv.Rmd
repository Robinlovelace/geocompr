Spatial cross-validation



- short intro spatial autocorrelation, maybe by showing artificial spatial datasets with different sills, nuggets, ranges (don't show the code but just the concept of spatial autocorrelation)
- spatial cross-validation when predictive performance is desirable 
- use Ecuador landslide data to spatially predict landslide susceptibility (GAM, i.e. a semiparametric extension of a GLM + refer to eco chapter in which we will use ml and where the hyperparameter tuning also requires an additional inner-fold tuning)

- What is spatial modeling and for what do we use it?
- What is cross-validation, why do we need it?
- What is spatial cv?

Spatial modeling: species distribution models, landslide susceptibility, epidemiology, disease mapping, rock glaciers, etc.

When we are interested in the accuracy of a model, i.e., when we want to assess a model's predictive performance, we want to avoid overfitting.^[short definition of overfitting]
Spatial autocorrelation will lead to overfitting when the training dataset is not independent of the test dataset which is frequently the case in temporal and spatial settings.

Usually people seek to accomplish one of the following aims when using supervised statistical learning techniques: 

1. Spatial prediction of the response variable
2. Inference about the relationship between response and predictors

In the latter case, we need to make sure to comply with all model assumptions (normality, heterogeneity, independence).
Spatial predictions are easier since we can argue that, the predictive performance of a model incorporating a (spatial) correlation structure is on average the same as for a model without a spatial correlation structure.
This is the reason why machine learning techniques (no explicit model assumptions) are so popular when the goal is a good prediction.
